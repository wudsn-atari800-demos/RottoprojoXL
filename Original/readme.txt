Story:
I decided to prove that it's possible to make a real rotated and
projected cube (with perspective) in 256 bytes on C=64 just like i've proved
the same thing using JavaScript on internet browsers a few years ago. When i
reached 256b limit, i remembered Ninja's 1 block love and reduced the size to
254 bytes to fit in 1 block. Now everybody is happy. :)

This is my first relase under Plush label. Don't worry, my future releases will
be the parts of Plush demos (spoiler warning!), not tiny codes like this one.

Thanks to my group buddies for allowing me to be a part of the Plush family.

Welcome to the 3d 256b intro era on C=64!
